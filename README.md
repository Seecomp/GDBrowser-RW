# Geometry Dash Browser: Rewritten [![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/momijiln/jsonga.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/momijiln/jsonga)
This project is a full back-end & front-end rewrite of [GDBrowser](https://github.com/GDColon/GDBrowser), a project by [GDColon](https://github.com/GDColon). All rights to the original project go to GDColon, while all the assets, fonts and such belong to [RobTopGames](http://robtopgames.com/). All code in this codebase was created by [myself](https://github.com/memimoe), for the major intent of attempting to see if I could improve upon GDColon's base.

This project primarily attempts to improve, and add more to the original code; as well.

# Installation
I personally will not help anyone with personal installation, as this is more of a built personal project; than to be one truly for "general purposes". Contributions are accepted, as long as you know how to install and setup this codebase yourself. Eventually, I will create instructions for how to use this in a general environment, but that's not in the foreseeable future at the moment.
